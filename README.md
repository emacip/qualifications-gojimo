Hi Seyed,Sorry for dont finished the test code but I had a really buzzy week doing other test code that I sent you too.My idea is try to finish this today or tomorrow morning, because I dont have more time, I have others projects.For the moment Its done all the import data from your API.this is my email emacipbelmonte@gmail.comPlease send me an emailThanks!!####The ChallengeDevelop a very simple working application on your chosen platform (Android / iOS / Web) with the following functionality:1. Read the following JSON feed containing a list of qualifications (a sample is presented below for your reference): https://api.gojimo.net/api/v4/qualifications2. Display a list of qualifications based on the data provided by the feed.3. Allow users to click a qualification to be presented with a list of subjects for that qualification.```{id: "d45945e4-b724-48ab-9f99-21e61f1648ad",name: "11+ Common Entrance",subjects: [{id: "ef319206-aa64-41f5-ac67-17a4fb8d10f6",title: "English",link: "/api/v4/subjects/ef319206-aa64-41f5-ac67-17a4fb8d10f6", colour: "#ECF7E2"}],default_products: [ ],created_at: "2014-04-12T10:06:33.000Z",updated_at: "2014-04-12T10:06:33.000Z",link: "/api/v4/qualifications/d45945e4-b724-48ab-9f99-21e61f1648ad" }```####BONUS POINTSWhilst not essential, we will be very pleased to see you take the challenge further by:1. Using the data provided to its full potential by taking advantage of fields like colour for subjects.2. Making the GUI as appealing and responsive as possible.3. Storing the data locally and refresh from the server as requested, taking advantage of the HTTP headers to avoid downloads of non-stale data.4. Unit testing your code.
